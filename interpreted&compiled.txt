An interpreted language is one that is parsed during runtime. An example of this is python or ruby. They are parsed during the actual runtime of the program that runs the script or file. A compiled language, like C, C++, or Swift is compiled before the code is ever run. Compilers help by parsing all of the code and making sure that everything "plays nice" and works. Interpreted languages do not have the benefit of being processed before hand to make sure that they work.
